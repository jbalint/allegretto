#+TITLE: (Example) System Evaluation (v1)

* Prolog
  This is an example system evaluation report. This is the first
  attempt at such a report. At current it does not address
  compare/contrast of systems, but aims to show ALL details that would
  make sense to address for a system.

  It's loosely based on the ~strategy_x3.R~ program.

  All input data is currently at hourly frequency.
* System
** Technical Analysis
   | Indicator       | Formula                                         |
   |-----------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   | *~SMAFast~*     | SMA(10)                                         |
   | *~SMASlow~*     | SMA(20)                                         |
   | *~ATR~*         | (TTR package default)                           |
   | *~MACrossover~* | ~sigCrossover(columns=c("SMAFast", "SMASlow"))~ |
   |                 |                                                 |
** Entry
   *~SMAFast~* crosses above *~SMASlow~*.
** Exit
   Crosses back
* Indicators
  Showing only one month. Need good detailed view for technical
  indicators. Black line is some attempt at ATR stop. Blue is
  *~SMAFast~*.

  (*NOTE:* Need a lot of work on this graph. It needs to ideally be
  interactive.)

* E-Ratio
  TBD: Need analysis of this. This is *entry* edge only.

* Stuff to add:
  + Normalize
  + My "E-Ratio" like number that takes the whole system into account
  + Include fees into calculations
  + Weekly and/or monthly return and drawdown
