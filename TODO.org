Tasks:

* Avoid duplicate history captures
  + The history capture will add two sets of histories. For some
    reason the program receives it twice (InsertTradeHistories).
  + Avoid this by checking the position? And the symbol.
* Link together segments of history capture
  + The trade history is received in several record sources.
  + We can check if one is linked to the previous capture by checking
    the symbol and that the first time delta is one prior to the
    minimum previously seen.
	+ I think we see the highest time first? Need to check this. If
      not, will need to save entire segment in memory and then check
      for relation with previous segment.
* Experiment with GUI options to test a strategy on a history capture
  + Charting
	+ indicators
	+ subsetting / zooming
  + Need a general evaluation report of a strategy
	+ And a higher level one to collect evals several strategies and
      compare them
